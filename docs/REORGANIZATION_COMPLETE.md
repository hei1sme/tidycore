# ✅ TidyCore Reorganization Complete!

## 🎉 Successfully Reorganized TidyCore Project Structure

The TidyCore project has been **successfully reorganized** to follow modern Python project structure conventions and create a professional GitHub presentation while maintaining **100% functionality**.

## 📁 New Professional Structure

```text

│   └── tidycore/             # Main application package
├── 📁 config/               # Configuration files
│   └── config.json          # Application settings
├── 📁 scripts/              # Build and utility scripts
│   ├── build_release.py     # Release build script
│   └── manage_version.py    # Version management

└── 📄 requirements.txt      # Dependencies
```

## ✅ Verification Results

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Application runs successfully** with new structure
- ✅ **All imports work correctly** with updated paths
- ✅ **Configuration loads properly** from new location
- ✅ **Build process works perfectly** with reorganized files

### Build System
- ✅ **Build script executes successfully**: `python scripts/build_release.py`
- ✅ **Release package created correctly** with all necessary files
- ✅ **GitHub Actions workflow updated** to use new script location
- ✅ **PyInstaller configuration** works with new structure

### File Organization
- ✅ **Config file found and loaded** from `config/config.json`
- ✅ **Source code properly organized** in `src/tidycore/`
- ✅ **Documentation centralized** in `docs/` directory
- ✅ **Scripts organized** in `scripts/` directory

## 🔧 What Was Updated

### Import Structure
```python
# OLD (before reorganization)
from tidycore.gui import TidyCoreGUI
from tidycore.config_manager import load_config

# NEW (after reorganization)
from src.tidycore.gui import TidyCoreGUI
from src.tidycore.config_manager import load_config
```

### Build Process
```bash
# OLD
python build_release.py

# NEW
python scripts/build_release.py
```

### Configuration Path
```python
# OLD
CONFIG_PATH = get_absolute_path("config.json")

# NEW  
CONFIG_PATH = get_absolute_path("config/config.json")
```
