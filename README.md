Built with a modern user interface and a robust backend engine, TidyCore is the "set it and forget it" solution for maintaining a clean digital workspace.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Quick Installation (Recommended)

TidyCore is a portable application - no complex installation required!

1. **Download the latest release:** Go to the [**TidyCore Releases Page**](https://github.com/hei1sme/TidyCore/releases) on GitHub.
2. Download the `TidyCore-v2.0.0-Windows.zip` file from the latest release.
3. **Extract the archive:** Right-click the downloaded `.zip` file and select "Extract All..." to a location of your choice (e.g., your Desktop or `C:\Program Files`).
4. **Run the application:** Open the extracted `TidyCore` folder and double-click `TidyCore.exe`.

That's it! TidyCore will start, and its icon will appear in your system tray.

### Development Installation

For developers who want to run from source or contribute:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hei1sme/TidyCore.git
cd TidyCore

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python main.py
```

### First-Time Setup

On first launch, TidyCore will automatically detect your user's **Downloads** folder and begin watching it. You can change the target folder and all other settings by opening the dashboard from the system tray icon and navigating to the **Settings** page.

> **Note:** On Windows, you may see a "Windows protected your PC" SmartScreen prompt. This is because the application is not code-signed. Click **"More info"** and then **"Run anyway"** to proceed.
